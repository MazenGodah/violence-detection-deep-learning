# Real-Time Violence Detection 🚨

This repository contains my **Graduation Project**: a real-time violence detection system using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**.  
The model can detect violent actions from **videos, images, and live streams**, and is deployed as a **Flask web application**.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
- Trained a **MobileNet + Bi-LSTM** model for violence classification.  
- Implemented **real-time detection** from video streams (e.g., webcam).  
- Built and deployed a **Flask web app** for easy usage.  

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **Flask**  

---

## 🔹 Dataset
- [Real Life Violence Situations Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset/data)  

---

## 🔹 Features
✔️ Detects violence in **videos, images, and real-time streams**  
✔️ Lightweight model using **MobileNet + Bi-LSTM**  
✔️ Flask-based **web interface** for deployment  
✔️ Can be extended to real-world surveillance applications
